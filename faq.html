        <h2>How does Catalyst work?</h2>
        <p>After connecting with us and telling us more about you, we will send you a welcome message to orient you to the features of Catalyst. Consider this your official induction to the Catalyst community.</p>
        <p>On Monday, expect an email invitation asking when you can connect. You tell us when you are available to meet so we can know when to schedule a meeting for you. We’ll work on matching you with someone of interest to you. Pairings are formed by real people. Meetings do not discriminate based upon gender; so expect co-ed meetings.</p>
        <p>After we’ve matched you, you’ll receive an email from us on Wednesday night containing your meeting details for the week--who your match is, where to meet and at what time.</p>
        <p>After the meeting, we want to hear how it went, so expect one last email on Sunday asking for genuine feedback. The authenticity of the feedback you provide will help us better plan future meetings for you.</p>

        <h2>What cities do you service?</h2>
        <p>Right now we are only in Austin, TX.</p>
        <p>Want us to come to your city next, <a href="">shoot us a message</a></p>


        <h2>Am I obligated to accept a connection invitation every week?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely not! We send you connection invitations every Monday to check your Thursday, Friday and Saturday availability for the current week. If you are unable to meet that week, simply let us know and we won’t schedule a meeting for you.</p>
        <p>We kindly ask that you only say you're available if you can actually make the meeting. We realize that sometimes scheduling can be a bit of a challenge, but it's important to remember that canceling your meeting after saying you are available creates a bad experience for your match. If there's even the slightest chance that something might come up or change, please do not say you are available for a meeting.</p>
        <p>We take the quality of our Catalyst community very seriously and do suspend user accounts when we see multiple instances of low-quality meetings. We make these decisions based on things like cancellations, reschedules, and poor reviews. It's our way of keeping the experience positive for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Do you tell me who I will be meeting beforehand to make sure I want to meet them?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately we cannot. Our system is designed to optimize for convenience, rather than choice. Balancing both of these factors is a tricky problem as you might imagine. We do everything we can to make sure you're making quality connections with other Christian young professionals here in Austin. </p>

        <h2>What if I can't meet during the current time slots?</h2>
        <p>We are constantly opening up new time slots. We recommend you continue to read our connection invitations, sent out every Monday, so that we can let you know when we open up more.<p>

        <h2>How much does Catalyst cost?</h2>
        <p>The service is absolutely free. We're sponsor-funded and will monetize in the future via premium (even better!) services for our Catalyst community.</p>

        <h2>What if something comes up and I can’t make my Catalyst meeting?</h2>
        <p>We recommend sharing your phone number with your match prior to the meeting. You also have his or her email address for last resort to get in touch. Please let them know as soon as you realize you're not going to be able to make the meeting.</p>
        <p>If all else fails, <a href="">email us</a> and our Catalyst team will do their best to contact the other party.</p>

        <h2>What should I expect from a Catalyst meeting?</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to help Christian young professionals connect with each other across Austin to build kingdom-quality friendships.</p>

        <p>****(wordy) We believe that you never know what you might learn or what new opportunities you might discover from spending just a little bit of time with someone you may have never planned to cross paths with. We see divine connections and God-introductions happen every week.</p>

        <h2>What if I’m running late to a Catalyst meeting?</h2>
        <p>Most of our community members share their phone number prior to the meeting. A simple text message to your match will suffice.</p>
        <p>Please try not to have your match waiting for more than 5 minutes if possible. If all else fails, <a href="">email us</a> and she will do her best to contact the other party.</p>

        <h2>How long should I expect a Catalyst meeting to last?</h2>
        <p>We recommend keeping each meeting to thirty minutes or so. If you need to be somewhere, don't hesitate to let the other party know.</p>

        <h2>How do I opt-out of Catalyst?</h2>
        <p>If you no longer want to participate in Catalyst, <a href="">email us</a> with “Opt-out: [FIRST NAME LAST NAME] in the subject line.</p>
