        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Catalyst is a connection service used to unite Christian, young professionals across Austin(for now) for the expansion of God’s kingdom. </p>
        <p>Catalyst serves those who have recently moved to a new city, those who want to be introduced to community and those who want to expand the breadth of their community experience. There is a conversation for everyone and a common dialogue of God’s kingdom. A connection with another believer activates endless possibility for the Kingdom of God at hand.</p>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>Chris and Laurena have been friends since 2013 after connecting over a mission trip to the Dominican Republic. Attending different churches at the time, the Holy Spirit wove together a unique friendship centered on dialogue and activities that expand God’s kingdom. Through their time as students at UT, the topic of community surfaced as a recurring theme of conversation. They would volley questions back and forth like, “What is true community?” “What does it look like?” “How can we fully experience community?” and “Who wants in too?” </p>
        <p>In their search for true community, they experienced opportunities for interaction at church services, sessions for a school of ministry, outreach events, house church gatherings, large conferences, bible studies--you name it. While each experience was unique and presented the opportunity to interact with other believers, the desire for authentic, long-lasting connection across an entire generation still exists.</p>
        <p>In March, Laurena received divine inspiration from Heaven to create an app to connect God-fearing, young professionals across Austin. As she abided, she felt God’s heart to unify His body--across distance, time constraints, denominations and misconceptions. He magnified the need for connection and the usefulness of an app increased. Laurena proposed the idea to Chris, who is a developer, and Catalyst began to emerge.</p>

        <h2>Uniqueness</h2>
        <p>We create opportunities for you to connect. During a life stage where transience is a common experience and change occurs frequently, young adults feel a sense of stability with authentic relationships. This sense of stability empowers greater commitment to God’s biblical principles during the adulting process.</p>
        <p>We cross your path with others of like faith. Where do you meet other young professionals who are believers if you have a consistent work schedule and prior church commitments? How do individuals from multiple churches, across a city, cross-pollinate? We give you introductions to other believers you may have never known before.</p>
        <p>We want you to be you as you connect. Authenticity is key to creating a rhythmic reciprocity between two individuals. As Jesus loves the church, flaws and beauty; love all parts of the body so we can live as one.</p>
        <p>We facilitate connection so you can build friendship. While we believe God can do anything through these connections, Catalyst is not a Christian dating site. Free yourself from all expectations and come to a meeting ready to listen and appreciate God’s uniqueness on display in the other person.</p>
        <p>We won’t pull you away from your church family or present commitments. Catalyst is under the prayer covering of churches in Austin, but not associated with any specific program or agenda. Connections are intentionally created across church lines to unify the Church in Austin.</p>
